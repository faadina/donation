            Kompleks Anak Yatim Tahfiz Darul Hijrah is an independent educational institution established by Al Fadhil Ustaz Wan Muhammad Mizan bin Wan Abdul Latif in 2012. It was initiated to elevate an educational system based on the Quran and Sunnah, aiming to realize the aspiration of producing more Islamic scholars, particularly among orphans and the poor. This institution focuses on preventing dropouts and enabling these children to master the skills of memorizing, understanding the knowledge of the Quran, and comprehensively grasping Hadith.
